# react-seat-selector

## [Visit it here](https://iamtheyammer.github.io/react-seat-selector/)

Extremely simple **demo** of a seat selector in React.

Please keep in mind that this is using the react development script and the
in-browser babel transformer, so this is not ready for production use.

You should use webpack to build this for production.
